        <h2>Understanding Geometry</h2>
        <p>
          Geometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with the properties and
          relations of points, lines, surfaces, and solids. It helps in
          understanding the physical world around us.
        </p>
  
        <h3>Basic Shapes</h3>
        <p>
          Learn about various shapes such as circles, triangles, rectangles, and
          polygons. Understand their properties and how to calculate areas and
          perimeters.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong> The area of a rectangle is calculated using
          <code>A = l Ã— w</code>, where <code>l</code> is the length and
          <code>w</code> is the width.
        </p>
  
        <h3>Angles</h3>
        <p>
          Explore the types of angles (acute, obtuse, right) and their properties.
          Learn how to measure angles and use them to solve geometry problems.
        </p>
  
        <h3>3D Shapes</h3>
        <p>
          Understand three-dimensional shapes like cubes, cylinders, and spheres.
          Learn to calculate their surface areas and volumes.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Real-Life Applications of Geometry</h2>
        <p>Geometry is used in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Architectural design and construction.</li>
          <li>Creating visual arts and designs.</li>
